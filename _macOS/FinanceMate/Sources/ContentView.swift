// Purpose: Main content view for the FinanceMate application.
// Issues & Complexity: Currently a simple placeholder view. Will need to be expanded for navigation and main app functionality.
// -- Pre-Coding Assessment --
// Issues & Complexity Summary: Basic SwiftUI view that serves as the entry point for the application.
// Key Complexity Drivers (Values/Estimates):
//   - Logic Scope (New/Mod LoC Est.): ~15
//   - Core Algorithm Complexity: Low (simple view structure)
//   - Dependencies (New/Mod Cnt.): 0
//   - State Management Complexity: Low (no state management currently implemented)
//   - Novelty/Uncertainty Factor: Low (standard SwiftUI view)
// AI Pre-Task Self-Assessment (Est. Solution Difficulty for AI %): 10%
// Problem Estimate (Inherent Problem Difficulty %): 15% (Relative to other problems in `root/` folder)
// Initial Code Complexity Estimate (Est. Code Difficulty %): 10% (Relative to other files in `root/`)
// Justification for Estimates: Basic SwiftUI view with minimal complexity, no state management or complex UI elements.
// -- Post-Implementation Update --
// Final Code Complexity (Actual Code Difficulty %): 10%
// Overall Result Score (Success & Quality %): 85%
// Key Variances/Learnings: Will need significant expansion to meet app requirements.
