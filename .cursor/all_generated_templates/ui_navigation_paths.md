## TEMPLATE SECTION (PROJECT-AGNOSTIC)

### Purpose of This Document
This document serves as a comprehensive reference for all navigation paths within the application's UI. It provides a structured way to document and understand how users and testers can navigate to each view or screen, supporting both manual testing and automated UI validation.

### Document Structure
- **View Names**: Clear identification of each view/screen
- **Navigation Paths**: Step-by-step instructions to reach each view
- **Accessibility Hierarchy**: Structured representation of view hierarchy 
- **Programmatic Selection**: Code snippets for programmatic navigation
- **State Dependencies**: Conditions that affect view appearance/behavior
- **UI Element Structure**: Key UI components and their properties

### Best Practices
- Document every view with its exact name as used in code
- Provide clear, numbered steps for navigation
- Include accessibility identifiers for all key elements
- Document state-dependent UI (e.g., elements that only appear under certain conditions)
- Update immediately when navigation structure changes
- Reference in test documentation and UI automation scripts
