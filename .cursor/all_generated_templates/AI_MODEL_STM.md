## TEMPLATE SECTION (PROJECT-AGNOSTIC)

### Purpose of This Document
This document records AI agent short-term memory (STM) snapshots at major decision points, reasoning processes, and context-loading events. It serves as a transparent record of AI decision-making and provides traceability for development actions.

### Document Structure
- **Timestamp**: When the STM snapshot was taken
- **Context**: Current project state and task focus
- **Current Task**: The specific task being addressed
- **Key Context Loaded**: Important documents/information that influenced decisions
- **Reasoning/Plan**: Thought process and intended approach
- **Blockers/Uncertainties**: Identified obstacles or areas of uncertainty
- **Summary**: Brief recap of recent user/system interaction

### Best Practices
- Record STM snapshots at all major decision points
- Document context-loading events to track information influencing decisions
- Provide clear reasoning for planned actions
- Identify blockers or uncertainties requiring human input
- Maintain chronological order with most recent entries at the top
