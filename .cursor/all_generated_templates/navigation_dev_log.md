## TEMPLATE SECTION (PROJECT-AGNOSTIC)

### Purpose of This Document
This document serves as a chronological log of UI/UX implementation tasks, validation efforts, and test results. It provides a comprehensive record of how each UI element was implemented, tested, and validated, supporting traceability and quality assurance.

### Document Structure
- **Implementation Task**: Each major UI/UX implementation with details
- **Task Specification**: Requirements and expectations for the feature
- **View Information**: Details about view names, access paths, and state dependencies
- **User Flow**: Step-by-step description of how users interact with the feature
- **UI Testing Path**: Exact steps used to test and validate the implementation
- **Validation Results**: Objective results of testing, including screenshots and OCR validation
- **Implementation Notes**: Technical details and decisions made during implementation

### Best Practices
- Document each UI/UX implementation as a separate entry
- Include clear view names and navigation paths for every implementation
- Always document state dependencies (when elements appear/disappear)
- Include screenshots for all visual validations
- Document OCR validation results objectively
- Record both successes and failures for continuous improvement
- Update the log promptly after each implementation or validation activity
