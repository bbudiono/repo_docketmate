## TEMPLATE SECTION (PROJECT-AGNOSTIC)

### Purpose of This Document
This document details the specific configuration settings, project structure, and build requirements for Xcode projects. It serves as a reference for developers to understand the application architecture, key components, and critical build parameters, ensuring consistent and reliable builds across all development environments.

### Document Structure
- **Project Structure Overview**: Directory layout and key components
- **Key Views and Components**: Core application views and their relationships
- **Redundancy Check Guidelines**: Procedures for identifying and handling duplicate/obsolete files
- **Build Configuration Settings**: Essential build settings for proper compilation
- **View Relationships and Dependencies**: Component interactions and hierarchy

### Best Practices
- Update this document whenever project structure or build settings change
- Ensure configuration settings are consistent across all build environments
- Document view dependencies to prevent unintended side effects during refactoring
- Use this reference when evaluating files for potential redundancy
- Pair this document with the main build guide for complete build context
