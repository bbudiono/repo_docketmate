## TEMPLATE SECTION (PROJECT-AGNOSTIC)

### Purpose of This Document
This document serves as the definitive reference for building, configuring, and maintaining Xcode projects. It establishes standardized procedures for project setup, build processes, troubleshooting, and compatibility requirements to ensure consistent and stable builds across all development environments.

### Document Structure
- **Quick Start**: Essential commands and procedures for common build tasks
- **Project Structure Standards**: Required directory layout and file organization
- **Build Standards & Requirements**: Core build settings, commands, and environment configuration
- **Build Stability Guide**: Preventative measures and resolution procedures for build issues
- **Restoration Procedures**: Methods to recover from project corruption or build failures
- **Testing Framework**: Standards for test implementation and execution
- **Continuous Integration**: Configuration for automated build and test processes
- **Platform-Specific Requirements**: Settings specific to target platforms and versions

### Best Practices
- Follow the project structure standards religiously to ensure build stability
- Run integrity checks before commits that modify project configuration
- Document all build failures and resolutions thoroughly
- Maintain regular backups of working project configurations
- Never modify project files manually when automated tools are available
- Reference the cross-referenced documents for detailed guidance
