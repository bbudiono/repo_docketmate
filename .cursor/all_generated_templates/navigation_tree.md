## TEMPLATE SECTION (PROJECT-AGNOSTIC)

### Purpose of This Document
This document provides a visual representation and structured documentation of the application's navigation structure. It serves as a reference for understanding the hierarchy of views, navigation paths, and state transitions within the application.

### Document Structure
- **Navigation Diagram**: Visual representation of the app's navigation structure
- **View Details**: Information about each view, including identifiers and content

- **Action Reference**: Information about user actions that trigger navigation or state changes

### Best Practices
- Keep the navigation tree up-to-date with all views and transitions
- Use consistent naming that matches the actual view names in code
- Document all state variations that affect navigation or UI presentation
- Include identifiers used for programmatic navigation
- Update this document whenever new views are added or navigation paths change
- Reference this document in UI testing and validation procedures
