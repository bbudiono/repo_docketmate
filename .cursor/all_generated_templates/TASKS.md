## TEMPLATE SECTION (PROJECT-AGNOSTIC)

### Purpose of This Document
This document serves as the central hub for tracking all tasks, subtasks, and their status. It provides a clear breakdown of work items, priorities, dependencies, and completion status to ensure effective project management and progress tracking.

### Document Structure
- **Task List**: Complete list of tasks and subtasks with ID, status, priority, and dependencies
- **Task Breakdown**: Detailed descriptions of each task, including requirements and acceptance criteria
- **Priorities**: Explanation of priority levels and their meaning
- **Dependencies**: Mapping of task dependencies and blockers
- **Status Legend**: Definitions of different status values used in the document
- **Notes & Comments**: Additional context, observations, or implementation details

### Best Practices
- Break down tasks to Level 5-6 (atomic, implementable units of work)
- Keep status and priority up-to-date for all tasks
- Document dependencies explicitly to prevent surprises
- Add detailed comments for complex tasks or implementation decisions
- Reference related documentation and code changes
- Log all completed tasks with timestamps and outcomes
