Authentication Architecture\n   - AuthManager properly configured with delegate pattern\n   - TokenManager for secure credential storage\n   - Proper error handling and state management\n\n3. CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED\n   - Current AppleAuthProvider in `DocketMate-Sandbox/Authentication/AuthenticationProvider.swift` is FAKE\n   - Only generates mock userId like \"apple-user-12345678\"\n   - No actual Apple Sign In API calls (ASAuthorizationController)\n   - Missing real nonce generation, credential validation, etc.\n\n4. REAL IMPLEMENTATION EXISTS\n   - Found complete real implementation in `Sources/Authentication/AppleAuthProviderSandbox.swift`\n   - Uses proper ASAuthorizationAppleIDProvider, nonce generation, SHA256 hashing\n   - Implements ASAuthorizationControllerDelegate correctly\n   - Has both real and mock modes for testing\n\nNEXT STEPS FOR 100% FEATURE PARITY:\n1. Replace fake AppleAuthProvider with real implementation (imports added)\n2. Update class to use ASAuthorizationController APIs\n3. Test real Apple Sign In flow in Sandbox\n4. Apply working solution to Production\n5.

The validation process must:\n\n1. Verify the token's signature using Apple's public key (ES256 algorithm)\n2. Validate the token's claims including:\n   - Issuer (`iss`) must be \"https://appleid.apple.com\"\n   - Audience (`aud`) must match our app's client ID\n   - Expiration time (`exp`) must be checked against current time\n   - Token issuance time (`iat`) must be reasonable\n\nThe real Apple authentication implementations in both environments (`AppleAuthProvider.swift` and `AppleAuthProviderSandbox.swift`) need to incorporate proper token validation logic. Currently, neither environment is correctly validating tokens according to Apple's requirements.\n\nFor proper implementation, we should use Apple's REST API endpoints for token validation as documented in their developer resources. This will require generating and validating authorization tokens using the ES256 algorithm with our private key (.p8 file) from the Apple Developer Console.\n\nThe dual authentication system discovery explains why our token validation appears to work - the fake implementation bypasses actual token validation entirely. We must implement proper validation in the real authentication flow before migrating the application to use it.\n</info added on 2025-05-24T08:31:11.937Z>",
