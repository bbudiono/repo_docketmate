# Production Migration Plan - AI Frameworks Integration

## Migration Strategy: Sandbox â†’ Production

**Date:** June 2, 2025  
**Objective:** Migrate validated AI frameworks from Sandbox to Production environment  
**Approach:** Test-Driven Development (TDD) with comprehensive validation

## ðŸ“‹ Migration Checklist

### Phase 1: Core AI Frameworks Migration
- [ ] LangChain Framework (LangChainFramework.swift, LangChainCore.swift, LangChainToolRegistry.swift)
- [ ] LangGraph Framework (LangGraphFramework.swift, LangGraphCore.swift)
- [ ] Pydantic AI Framework (PydanticAIFramework.swift, PydanticAICore.swift)
- [ ] AI Framework Integration Layer (AIFrameworkIntegration.swift)
- [ ] Financial Report Generator (FinancialReportGenerator.swift)

### Phase 2: Service Layer Integration
- [ ] Update DocumentManager.swift with AI framework integration
- [ ] Update DocumentProcessingService.swift with enhanced capabilities
- [ ] Update FinancialDataExtractor.swift with improved extraction logic
- [ ] Update OCRService.swift with production-ready methods

### Phase 3: Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Migrate test infrastructure improvements
- [ ] Update test suites for production environment
- [ ] Validate all integrations work correctly

### Phase 4: Build Verification
- [ ] Ensure Production build compiles successfully
- [ ] Run comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Verify performance benchmarks
- [ ] Check memory usage and optimization

## ðŸ”§ Migration Process

### Step 1: Prepare Production Environment
1. Create AI framework directories in Production
2. Copy validated framework files with production modifications
3. Remove sandbox-specific comments and watermarks
4. Update import statements and dependencies

### Step 2: Framework Integration
1. Integrate frameworks one by one using TDD
2. Validate each framework individually
3. Test cross-framework communication
4. Ensure error handling works correctly

### Step 3: Service Layer Updates
1. Update existing services to use new AI capabilities
2. Maintain backward compatibility
3. Add enhanced functionality gradually
4. Test each service modification

### Step 4: Comprehensive Testing
1. Run full test suite
2. Performance testing
3. Memory leak detection
4. Crash testing with edge cases
5. UI automation testing

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] All AI frameworks build successfully in Production
- [ ] No compilation errors or warnings
- [ ] All tests pass (unit, integration, UI)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet targets
- [ ] Memory usage within acceptable limits
- [ ] No memory leaks detected

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] Code quality standards maintained
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Error handling comprehensive
- [ ] Logging and monitoring in place
- [ ] Security validations passed

### TestFlight Requirements
- [ ] App signing and provisioning correct
- [ ] Bundle ID and versioning correct
- [ ] All entitlements properly configured
- [ ] App Store Connect metadata ready
- [ ] Screenshot and description updated

## ðŸ“Š Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Core framework functionality (already validated in Sandbox)
- Basic integration patterns
- Documentation and comments

### Medium Risk
- Production-specific configurations
- Performance under production constraints
- Memory management in production environment

### High Risk
- Cross-framework dependencies
- Complex error scenarios
- Production signing and distribution

## ðŸ”„ Rollback Plan

If migration encounters critical issues:
1. Revert to previous Production state
2. Analyze failure points
3. Fix issues in Sandbox first
4. Re-attempt migration with fixes
