## 3.2 Colour Palette

### Deriving from Inspirations: Colours
Consider your top-ranked inspirations from Section 0.1.
* **Overall Feel:** Do your top inspirations have a light, dark, or vibrant theme? Are they professional and subdued (e.g., OmniFocus, Microsoft Office), clean and minimalist (e.g., Things, Craft, Bear), or data-dense with functional color coding (e.g., Bloomberg, TradingView)?
* **Primary/Brand Color:** How do your inspirations use their main brand color? Is it for all interactive elements (like Linear's purple), or more selectively for key calls to action and branding accents (like many Apple apps)?
* **Accent Colors:** Observe how accents are used. For subtle highlights (Fantastical), for categorization (Notion), or for user customization (some Setapp apps)?
* **Functional Colors:** Note the clarity and consistency of success, warning, and error states in your inspirations. Are they bold or subtle?
* **Backgrounds & Surfaces:** Do they use flat colors, subtle gradients, or rich materials (like Apple's vibrancy or Windows' Mica/Acrylic)? How do they create depth between layers?

### Defining Your Colour Palette:

## 6.4 Animation & Motion Guidelines (Aesthetics & Motion/Animation)

### Deriving from Inspirations: Motion & Animation
Consider your top-ranked inspirations from Section 0.1.
* **Overall Feel:** Is the motion snappy and immediate (Linear)? Fluid and physics-based (Native Apple Apps, Fantastical)? Subtle and utilitarian (OmniFocus)? Or more expressive and branded (some creative tools or Setapp apps)?
* **Purpose:** How is animation used? Primarily for feedback, for delightful transitions, to guide focus, or to explain spatial relationships?
* **Complexity:** Are animations simple fades and slides, or do they involve more complex choreography or 3D effects?

### Defining Your Motion & Animation Guidelines:

* **Purpose of Animation:** [As per original document]
* **Core Principles:**
    * **Desired Feel:** `[e.g., "Responsive and fluid, with physics-based interactions inspired by Apple HIG and Fantastical"]`
    * [Other principles as per original document: Performance, Subtlety, Meaningful, Consistency]
* **Standard Durations & Easing Curves:**
    (Define your timings and easing, referencing inspirations)
    * `Micro-interactions (Feedback)`: `[e.g., 120ms, ease-out]`
    * `Short Transitions (UI Elements)`: `[e.g., 220ms, ease-in-out]`
    * `Medium Transitions (View/Screen Changes)`: `[e.g., 300ms, custom spring (stiffness: X, damping: Y) or platform default]`
    * `Long Transitions (Use Sparingly)`: `[e.g., 450ms]`
    * **Easing Curves:** [Specify preferred curves or spring parameters]
* **Platform-Specific Animation Systems:** [As per original document]
* **Specific Animation Examples:**
    * **View Transitions:** `[e.g., "Default platform push/modal, with potential for shared element transitions inspired by Material Design if applicable"]`
    * **List Item Animations:** `[e.g., "Subtle fade-in and slide-up for new items, similar to Things"]`
    * [Other examples as per original document]
* **Reduced Motion:** [As per original document - MANDATORY]

## 6.5 System Feedback (Haptic, Sound, Alerts)
* **Haptic Feedback (iOS/iPadOS):**
    * Use standard haptics (e.g., `UIImpactFeedbackGenerator`, `UINotificationFeedbackGenerator`) to confirm actions or provide warnings.
    * Use appropriately and sparingly.
* **Sound Feedback:**
    * Generally avoid custom sounds unless core to the app's function.
    * If used, sounds should be subtle and provide meaningful feedback.
    * Provide an option to disable sounds.
* **Alerts & Notifications:** See Section 5.6 and Section 12.
