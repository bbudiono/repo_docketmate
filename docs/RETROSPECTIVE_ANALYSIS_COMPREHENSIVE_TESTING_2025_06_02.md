## TESTING INFRASTRUCTURE ANALYSIS

### Test Configuration Status
**Production Testing:**
- Scheme configured but test action not enabled (design choice for minimal production)
- Build verification successful - core functionality validated

**Sandbox Testing:**
- Comprehensive test suite configured with unit and UI tests
- SQLite.swift dependency properly resolved in test environment
- Test bundle creation successful
- UI test automation framework integrated

### Testing Approach Validation
The project follows a **Sandbox-First Development** approach where:
1. All new features developed and tested in Sandbox environment
2. Comprehensive testing performed in Sandbox with full test suite
3. Validated features promoted to Production environment
4. Production maintains minimal, stable configuration
