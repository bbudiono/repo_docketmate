## üìä Performance Analysis Framework

### üéØ Improvement Calculation Methodology

**Weighted Performance Improvement:**
```swift
let timeImprovement = (baseline.taskCompletionTime - enhanced.taskCompletionTime) / baseline.taskCompletionTime * 100
let accuracyImprovement = (enhanced.accuracyScore - baseline.accuracyScore) / baseline.accuracyScore * 100
let efficiencyImprovement = (enhanced.resourceEfficiency - baseline.resourceEfficiency) / baseline.resourceEfficiency * 100
let errorReduction = (baseline.errorRate - enhanced.errorRate) / baseline.errorRate * 100

// Weighted average improvement (30% time, 30% accuracy, 20% efficiency, 20% error reduction)
let weightedImprovement = (timeImprovement * 0.3) + (accuracyImprovement * 0.3) + (efficiencyImprovement * 0.2) + (errorReduction * 0.2)
```
