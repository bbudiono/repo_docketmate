// Purpose: Entry point for basic production test suite. Validates minimal app build and test infrastructure.
// Issues & Complexity: Minimal logic, but must ensure test harness is functional and compliant with TDD and .cursorrules. No business logic tested here.
// Ranking/Rating: 10% (Code), 10% (Problem) - Simple test harness, lowest complexity in _macOS/SynchroNext.
// AI Pre-Task Self-Assessment: 5% | Problem Estimate: 10% | Initial Code Complexity: 10% | Justification: Only validates test infra, no app logic. Last Updated: 2025-05-19
